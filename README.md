Welcome to my **[project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VJbJdagFcl4vClcHBO0rdLsNJ_CkqdmFgxv2oh-Li5g/edit?usp=sharing)**!

### Scenarios
- **Scenario 1**: Build a Factory  
- **Scenario 2**: Marketing Campaign and New Electronic Product  
- **Time Frame for Analysis**: 7 Years (2018-2024)  

### Methodology
The analysis compares the two projects using several key financial metrics:
- **Initial and Opportunity Costs**: Upfront capital and missed opportunity costs for each scenario.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Measures profitability by comparing future cash flows to the initial investment.
- **Payback Period**: Time taken to recover the initial investment through cash inflows.
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Annualized return over the project’s lifecycle, assessing investment attractiveness.
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Overall return relative to the initial project cost.
- **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**: Evaluates the cost of financing the project.
- **EURO STOXX 50**: Serves as a market benchmark for comparison.

### Conclusions
- **Investment Decision**:  
  Choose **Scenario 1** for higher returns with lower initial investment. Choose **Scenario 2** if willing to invest more upfront for potentially higher long-term profit.  

- **Profitability**:  
  While Scenario 2 has a higher NPV, Scenario 1 demonstrates superior efficiency with a higher IRR and ROI, as well as a lower initial cost.  

- **Risk vs. Return**:
  Scenario 1 offers better returns (higher IRR and ROI). Scenario 2's higher costs increase investment risk without proportionately higher returns.
